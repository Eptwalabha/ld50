# LD 50 : Delay the inevitable

## Story:

You wake up in a fully automated supermarket that'll close its doors in 5 minutes.  
You need to quickly find enough resources to survive to the next day.  
Don't worry, there's plenty of goods to be consume todayâ€¦ but will it be the case tomorrow?  

As our earth's resources depletes, we need to slow down on our consumptions.
This is easier said than done. In fact from the outside, it looks like we've done very little.


## Gameplay:

The player wakes up in the middle of a huge supermarket.  
It has 5 minutes to find enough resources to survive the day.  

At the end of the 5 minutes, the player pays what he picked in the aisles of the supermarket then starts a new day all over again.

Depending on how the player consumes, the supermarket will be more or less restocked.
The aisles restock depends on how much the player over-consumes (or wastes) items.
The more is wasted, the lesser the aisles will be replenished the next day.
On the contrary, if the player does not consume enough, It will receive a finacial penalty that cover its needs. The restok won't be increased.

Every day the player receives 100 credits that can be carried over to the next days.

After a week, the games ends with a reveal.
